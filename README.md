# Covid19-Analysis-Modeling

##Topic Introduction
The topic our team is investigating is COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Originating on December 12th, 2019 in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has subsequently spread across the world, reaching a case count of over 330 million and a death count of over 5.5 million. With concern for public health in consideration, the ability to model and predict the spread of COVID-19 is imperative to tackling this pandemic.
